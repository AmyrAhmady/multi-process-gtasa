# Multi Process GTASA

With this ASI mod you are able to run GTASA multiple times, without game pause on window focus loss

If you also wish to have windowed mode ability, you can use https://github.com/ThirteenAG/III.VC.SA.WindowedMode
With this mod and multi process gtasa mod, you can run multiple GTA:SA game instances each in windowed mode and different resolutions, so you end up having multiple GTA:SA windows on a single screen/monitor


## NOTE
There are some possible issues with different ASI Loaders  
This mod works completely fine if you are using `Silent's ASI Loader`;  
But if you are using `Ultimate ASI Loader` (ThirteenAG's) you must change your `dinput8.dll` file name to `vorbisFile.dll`  
Same goes for any other ASI Loader you are using, if it's possible, change your file name to `vorbisFile.dll` so game picks it up sooner than others
